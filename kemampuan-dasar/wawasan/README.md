**MATERI DAN PENJELASAN (RUANG LINGKUP PENGEMBANGAN SOFTWARE)**

1.  **Information technology**

>   Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve,
>   transmit, and manipulate data or information. IT is typically used within
>   the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment
>   technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and
>   communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT
>   system) is generally an information system, a communications system or, more
>   specifically speaking, a computer system – including all hardware, software
>   and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of users.

>   **Electronic data processing**

-   Data storage

-   Databases

-   Data retrieval

-   Data transmission

-   Data manipulation

1.  **What's the difference between Computer Science and Informatics?**

>   Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and
>   engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is
>   the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications
>   and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and
>   mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the
>   acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and
>   access to information. Informatics is a branch of information engineering.
>   It involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of
>   information systems, and as an academic field it is an applied form of
>   information science. The field considers the interaction between humans and
>   information alongside the construction of interfaces, organisations,
>   technologies and systems.

1.  **Software development**

>   Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing,
>   programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and
>   maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software
>   development is a process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in
>   a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of
>   the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software,
>   sometimes in a planned and structured process. Therefore, software
>   development may include research, new development, prototyping,
>   modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities
>   that result in software products.

>   Most methodologies share some combination of the following stages of
>   software development:

>   **Software development activities**

-   Analyzing the problem

-   Market research

-   Gathering requirements for the proposed business solution

-   Devising a plan or design for the software-based solution

-   Implementation (coding) of the software

-   Testing the software

-   Deployment

-   Maintenance and bug fixing

1.  **Agile software development**

>   Agile software development comprises various approaches to software
>   development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the
>   collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their
>   customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary
>   development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages
>   rapid and flexible response to change.

>   **The Manifesto for Agile Software Development**

>   **Agile software development value**

>   Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others
>   do that, the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they
>   value:

-   Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools

-   Working Software over comprehensive documentation

-   Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation

-   Responding to Change over following a plan

>   **Agile software development principles**

>   The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:

-   Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

-   Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.

-   Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)

-   Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers

-   Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted

-   Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)

-   Working software is the primary measure of progress

-   Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace

-   Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design

-   Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential

-   Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing
    teams

-   Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts
    accordingly

1.  **Scrum (software development)**

>   Scrum is an agile process framework for managing complex knowledge work,
>   with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used
>   in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex
>   work, research and advanced technologies.

>   As the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the
>   communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:

-   Define and announce releases.

-   Communicate delivery and team status.

-   Share progress during governance meetings.

-   Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions)
    with stakeholders.

-   Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.

-   Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.

1.  **Extreme programming**

>   Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is
>   intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer
>   requirements. Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in
>   pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, avoiding
>   programming of features until they are actually needed, a flat management
>   structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer's
>   requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and
>   frequent communication with the customer and among programmers.

>   **Concept**

-   Goals

-   Activities

-   Coding

-   Testing

>   Testing is central to extreme programming. Extreme programming's approach is
>   that if a little testing can eliminate a few flaws, a lot of testing can
>   eliminate many more flaws.

-   Unit tests determine whether a given feature works as intended. Programmers
    write as many automated tests as they can think of that might "break" the
    code; if all tests run successfully, then the coding is complete. Every
    piece of code that is written is tested before moving on to the next
    feature.

-   Acceptance tests verify that the requirements as understood by the
    programmers satisfy the customer's actual requirements.

-   Listening

-   Designing

-   Value

-   Communication

-   Simplicity

-   Feedback

>   Within extreme programming, feedback relates to different dimensions of the
>   system development:

-   Feedback from the system: by writing unit tests, or running periodic
    integration tests, the programmers have direct feedback from the state of
    the system after implementing changes.

-   Feedback from the customer: The functional tests (aka acceptance tests) are
    written by the customer and the testers. They will get concrete feedback
    about the current state of their system.

-   Feedback from the team: When customers come up with new requirements in the
    planning game the team directly gives an estimation of the time that it will
    take to implement.

-   Courage

-   Respect

-   Rules

>   Here are some of the rules (incomplete):

-   Coding

1.  The customer is always available

2.  Code the unit test first

3.  Only one pair integrates code at a time

4.  Leave optimization until last

5.  No overtime

-   Testing

1.  All code must have unit tests

2.  All code must pass all unit tests before it can be released.

3.  When a bug is found, tests are created before the bug is addressed (a bug is
    not an error in logic; it is a test that was not written)

4.  Acceptance tests are run often and the results are published
